## Get Started with OpenVINO&trade; Model Zoo

The Open Model Zoo in the Intel&reg; Distribution of OpenVINO&trade; includes optimized deep learning models and a set of demos for developing high-performance deep learning inference applications. You can use free pre-trained models to speed-up development and deployment.  To check the currently available models, use the [Model Downloader](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/omz_tools_downloader.html).  It is a set of python scripts for browsing and downloading these pre-trained models. Other automation tools are also available:

- downloader.py (model downloader) downloads model files from online sources and, if necessary, patches them to make them more usable with Model Optimizer.
- converter.py (model converter) converts the models that are not in the Inference Engine (IR) format into that format using Model Optimizer.
- quantizer.py (model quantizer) quantizes full-precision models in the IR format into low-precision versions using Post-Training Optimization Toolkit.
- info_dumper.py (model information dumper) prints information about the models in a stable machine-readable format

Use the following instructions to run downloader.py.  This example runs on a Linux* machine with source installation.  

``` 
python3 /opt/intel/openvino_2021/deployment_tools/open_model_zoo/tools/downloader/downloader.py --help

usage: downloader.py [-h] [--name PAT[,PAT...]] [--list FILE.LST] [--all]

[--print_all] [--precisions PREC[,PREC...]] [-o DIR]
[--cache_dir DIR] [--num_attempts N]
[--progress_format {text,json}] [-j N]

optional arguments:
--help show this help message and exit
--name PAT[,PAT...] download only models whose names match at least one ofspecified patterns
--list FILE.LST download only models whose names match at least one ofpatterns in the specified file
--all  download all available models
--print_all print all available models
--precisions PREC[,PREC...]

download only models with the specified precisions:
(actual for DLDT networks)

-o DIR, --output_dir DIR

path for saving models:
--cache_dir DIR directory to use as a cache for downloaded files
--num_attempts N attempt each download up to N times
--progress_format {text,json}

which format to use for progress reporting:

-j N, --jobs N how many downloads to perform concurrently</code>
```

Use the parameter --print_all to see which pre-trained models are available for download in the current version of OpenVINO.  The following example is a classic computer vision network used to detect a target picture.  Download ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco using [Model Downloader](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/omz_tools_downloader.html).

``` 
python3 /opt/intel/openvino_2021/deployment_tools/open_model_zoo/tools/downloader/downloader.py --name ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco</code>
```

## OpenVINO&trade; Model Optimizer

Model Optimizer is a cross-platform command-line tool that facilitates the transition between the training and deployment environment, performs static model analysis, and adjusts deep learning models for optimal execution on end-point target devices.  For more information see the [Model Optimizer Development Guide](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2021.3/openvino_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html)

Model Optimizer assumes you have a network model trained using a supported deep learning framework. The figure below shows the typical workflow for deploying a trained deep learning model:

![Typical workflow for deploying a trained deep learning model](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/openvino-workflow.jpg)

Figure 2. [Typical workflow for deploying a trained deep learning model](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2021.3/openvino_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html) [2]

Network topology files are described in .xml format.  Weights and biases are stored in binary format in .bin files.

To be able to convert ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco model into IR, some model specific parameters must be provided to the Model Optimizer.  A .yml file with model specific information was downloaded when thie model was downloaded from Open Model Zoo.  Here is an example for ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco:

``` 
cat /opt/intel/openvino_2021/deployment_tools/open_model_zoo/models/public/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco/model.yml
```

The Model Downloader also contains another handy script &#39;converter.py&#39; for accurately inputting the parameters of the downloaded model to the Model Optimizer (MO). Use this script for model conversion to reduce the workload.

``` 
python3 /opt/intel/openvino_2021/deployment_tools/open_model_zoo/tools/downloader/converter.py \
--download_dir=. \
--output_dir=. \
--name=ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco \
--dry_run
```

You can choose to convert the model using &ldquo;converter.py&rdquo; or use the Model Optimizer execution parameters that were generated by the command above and add them as input parameters shown below:

``` 
python3 /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/mo.py \
--framework=tf \
--data_type=FP32 \
--output_dir=public/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco/FP32 \
--model_name=ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco \
--reverse_input_channels \
--input_shape=[1,300,300,3] \
--input=image_tensor \
--output=detection_scores,detection_boxes,num_detections \
--transformations_config=/opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/extensions/front/tf/ssd_v2_support.json \

## Practice Inference Engine API

After creating intermediate representation files using the Model Optimizer, use the Inference Engine to infer the result for a given input data. The Inference Engine is a C++ library with a set of C++ classes to infer input data (images) and get a result. The C++ library provides an API to read the intermediate representation, set the input and output formats, and execute the model on devices.

The Inference Engine is a software component that contains the complete implementation for inference on various Intel&reg; hardware devices: CPU, GPU, VPU, FPGA, etc. Each of these plugins implements the unified API along with hardware-specific APIs.  The following figure show the steps of the integration process:

![Integration process](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/openvino-integration.jpg)

Figure 3. [Integration process] (https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_docs_IE_DG_Deep_Learning_Inference_Engine_DevGuide.html) [3]

### Load Plugin

Create Inference Engine Core to manage available devices and their plugins internally.

![Load Plugin](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/openvino-code1.jpg)

### Read Model IR

Read a model IR created by the Model Optimizer.

![Real Model IR](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/openvino-code2.jpg)

### Configure Input and Output

The information about the input and output layers of the network is stored in the loaded neural network object net.  Use the following two parameters to obtain the information about the  ef layers and set the inference execution accuracy of the network:

 - input_info
 - outputs

![Configure Input and Output](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/openvino-code3.jpg)

### Load Model

Load the model to the device using:

 - InferenceEngine::Core::LoadNetwork()

![Load Model]/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/openvino-code4.jpg)

### Create Inference Request and Prepare Input

To perform a neural network inference, read the image from disk and bind it to the input blob. After loading the image, determine the size of the image and format of the layout. For example, the default layout format of OpenCV is CHW, but the original layout of the image was HWC.  Modify the layout format and add the Batch size N dimension, then organize the image format according to NCHW and resize the input image to the network input size.

![](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/openvino-code5.jpg)

### Inference Calls

This example uses the synchronous API to demonstrate how to perform inference, calling:

- InferenceEngine::InferRequest::Infer()

To improve the inference performance, use the asynchronous API for inference as follows:

- InferenceEngine::InferRequest::StartAsync()
- InferenceEngine::InferRequest::Wait()

![Inference Call](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/openvino-code6.jpg)

### Process the Output

After the inference engine inputs the graph and performs inference, a result is generated. The result contains a list of classes (class_id), confidence and bounding boxes. For each bounding box, the coordinates are given relative to the upper left and lower right corners of the original image. The correspondence between class_id and the labels file allow us to parse the text corresponding to the class, which is used to facilitate human reading comprehension.

## Practice Post-Training Optimization Tool (POT)

POT is designed to accelerate the inference of deep learning models by applying special methods without model retraining or fine-tuning, liked post-training quantization. Therefore, the tool does not require a training dataset or a pipeline. To apply post-training algorithms from the POT, you need:

- A full precision model, FP32 or FP16, converted into the OpenVINO&trade; Intermediate Representation (IR) format

- A representative calibration dataset of data samples representing a use case scenario, for example, 300 images

The tool is aimed to fully automate the model transformation process without changing the model structure. The POT is available only in the Intel&reg; Distribution of OpenVINO&trade; toolkit.  For details about the low-precision flow in OpenVINO&trade;, see the [Low Precision Optimization Guide](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/pot_docs_LowPrecisionOptimizationGuide.html).

Post-training Optimization Tool includes a standalone command-line tool and a Python* API that provide the following key features:

- Two post-training 8-bit quantization algorithms: fast [DefaultQuantization](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/pot_compression_algorithms_quantization_default_README.html) and precise [AccuracyAwareQuantization](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/pot_compression_algorithms_quantization_accuracy_aware_README.html).

- Global optimization of post-training quantization parameters using the [Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/pot_compression_optimization_tpe_README.html).

- Symmetric and asymmetric quantization schemes. For details, see the [Quantization](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/pot_compression_algorithms_quantization_README.html) section.

- Compression for different hardware targets such as CPU and GPU.

- Per-channel quantization for Convolutional and Fully-Connected layers.

- Multiple domains: Computer Vision, Recommendation Systems.

- Ability to implement a custom optimization pipeline via the supported [API](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/pot_compression_api_README.html).

Before we start using the POT tool, we will need to prepare some config files:

- dataset files

- dataset definitions file: dataset_definitions.yml

- model json config for POT: ssd_mobilenetv1_int8.json

- model accuracy checker config: ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco.yml


### Dataset Preparation

This example shows the dataset of [Common Objects in Context (COCO)](https://cocodataset.org/#home).  The model was trained with this dataset.  Prepare the dataset according to [Dataset Preparation Guide](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/blob/release/data/datasets.md).

Download COCO dataset:

- Download [2017 Val images](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip) and [2017 Train/Val annotations](http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/annotations_trainval2017.zip)

- Unpack archives

Global Dataset Configuration

If you want to use the definitions file in quantization via Post Training Optimization Toolkit (POT),  input the correct file path in these fields in the global dataset configuration file:

- annotation_file: [PATH_TO_DATASET]/instances_val2017.json
- data_source: [PATH_TO_DATASET]/val2017

Prepare Model Quantization and Configuration

Create two config files.  One to include model specific and another for the dataset specific configurations.

- ssd_mobilenetv1_int8.json
- ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco.yml

1. Create a new file and name it ssd_mobilenetv1_int8.json. This is the POT configuration file.

![](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/openvino-code9.jpg)

2. Create a dataset config file and name it ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco.yml

![](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/openvino-code10.jpg)

### Quantize the Model

Run the Accuracy checker tool and POT tool to create your quantized IR files.

![](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/openvino-code11.jpg)

### Compare FP32 and INT8 Model Performance

This demonstrates how to run the Benchmark Python* Tool, which performs inference using convolutional networks. Performance can be measured for two inference modes: synchronous (latency-oriented) and asynchronous (throughput-oriented).

Upon start-up, the application reads command-line parameters and loads a network and images/binary files to the Inference Engine plugin, which is chosen depending on a specified device. The number of infer requests and execution approach depend on the mode defined with the -api command-line parameter. For more information see [OpenVINO&trade; Inference Engine Tools Benchmark Tool README](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2020.4/openvino_inference_engine_tools_benchmark_tool_README.html)

Please run both of your FP32 and INT8 models on [Benchmark Python* Tool](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_inference_engine_tools_benchmark_tool_README.html) and compare your results.

![](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/openvino-code12.jpg)

Now that you have run both your FP32 and INT8 IRs, you can make a comparison of the performance gain you are achieving with INT8 IR files. See the official [benchmark results for Intel&reg; Distribution of OpenVINO&trade; Toolkit](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_docs_performance_benchmarks_openvino.html) on various Intel&reg; hardware settings.

## Conclusion
