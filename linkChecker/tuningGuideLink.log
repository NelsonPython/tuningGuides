SENTENCE:  	<li>To avoid artificial contention in the CPU L1/L2 caches. When hyperthreading is enabled, two virtual (logical) cores run concurrently on the same physical core. Some hardware resources (e.g. L1/L2 caches) are shared between the two virtual cores. To configure &lt; --executor-cores &gt; as odd number would inevitably assign the two virtual cores on some physical cores to different Spark executors (i.e. processes) and therefore introduce artificial cache contention. Some commonly used BKMs ( &lt; --executor-cores 5 &gt; from &lt;<a href="https://blog.cloudera.com/how-to-tune-your-apache-spark-jobs-part-2/">How-to: Tune Your Apache Spark Jobs (Part 2) - Cloudera Blog</a>&gt; need some refinement to avoid such cache contention</li>

SENTENCE:  <p>Relational database management system (RDBMS) provides some of the most important foundational component in enterprise software architecture. Based on the relational model of data the database software uses the industry standard SQL (Structured Query Language) to define and query the data stored within the relations. Relational databases have proved the most popular format for data storage and retrieval for over 40 years and the RDS (Relational Database Service) continues to be the fastest growing service offered by cloud service providers. The DB-Engines ranking&nbsp;<a href="https://db-engines.com/">https://db-engines.com/</a>&nbsp;lists the most popular databases with relational databases making 74% of the total ranking. Relational database workloads are divided into two general categories, OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) with both workloads having considerably different characteristics.</p>

SENTENCE:  <p>In this paper we focus upon tuning for OLTP workloads for the two most popular ranked open-source RDBMS, MySQL and PostgreSQL. MySQL is the most popular open source RDBMS and has been running on Intel platforms for over 25 years. The latest version 8.0.23 was released January 2021. MySQL supports the use of multiple storage engines definable for table creation. For the highest levels of performance, we recommend upgrading to MySQL 8.0.23 using the InnoDB storage engine to benefit from the latest InnoDB scalability enhancements. Learn more about MySQL at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mysql.com/about/">https://www.mysql.com/about/</a>. PostgreSQL is the fastest growing database in popularity for RDBMS and provides the foundation for many enhanced database releases such as Citus*, Greenplum* and EnterpriseDB*. The latest PostgreSQL version is 13 with the current minor version of 13.2. PostgreSQL 13 provides performance and scalability improvements over previous versions and we therefore recommend all customers to move to this version if possible.

SENTENCE:  <p>The HammerDB TPROC-C test result produces two key metrics, New Orders Per Minute (NOPM) and Transactions Per Minute (TPM). NOPM is a close relation of the official tpmC statistic recording only new orders per minute and is the recommend metric to use to measure database performance being comparable between different databases. TPM is a complementary metric used to measure the performance of a specific database engine and relate performance to other statistics generated by that engine.
