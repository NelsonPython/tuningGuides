## Introduction

This guide is for users who are already familiar with deep learning using [Intel® AVX512](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-animation.html) and [Intel® Deep Learning Boost](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/deep-learning-boost.html). It provides recommendations for configuring hardware and software that will provide the best performance in most situations. However, please note that we rely on the users to carefully consider these settings for their specific scenarios, since these tools can be deployed in multiple ways.

The 3rd Generation Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable Processor platform has the following advantages:

- Speedy processing of memory-intensive workloads such as 3D-CNN topologies used in medical imaging, GAN, seismic analysis, genome sequencing, etc.
- Leveraging the simple ` numactl ` command for flexible core control and real-time inference even when the number of batches is small
- Cost-effective distributed training on large-scale clusters used to perform computations directly at the data source in order to avoid the additional costs of redundant data storage and expensive cache mechanisms
- Multiple types of workloads (HPC/BigData/AI) are supported on the same cluster to achieve better TCO
- SIMD acceleration
- The same infrastructure can be used for training and inference
- An active ecosystem full of developers, experts, and learners  

### Deep Learning Stages

A typical deep learning application has these stages:

![Neural Compressor Architecture](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/neuralCompressorArchitecture.png)

Each stage requires the allocation of these resources:  

- Computational power
- Memory
- Storage for datasets
- Communication link between compute nodes
- Optimized software

Choosing the right combination of resources greatly accelerates the efficiency of your AI services.  All of the processes including dataset preparation, model training, model optimization, and model deployment, can be done on a 3rd Generation Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable Processor platform-based infrastructure that supports machine learning/deep learning platforms for training and inference. A proposed infrastructure is shown in the figure below:

<h2><a id="_Toc67652282"></a><a id="_Toc68526401"></a>Introducing Intel&reg; AVX-512 and Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost</h2>

<p>Intel&reg; Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512) is a &ldquo;single instruction, multiple data&rdquo; (SIMD) instruction set based on x86 processors. Compared to traditional &ldquo;single instruction, single data&rdquo; instructions, a SIMD instruction allows for executing multiple data operations with a single instruction. As the name implies, Intel&reg; AVX-512 has a register width of 512 bits, and it supports 16 32-bit single-precision floating-point numbers or 64 8-bit integers.</p>

<p>Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable Processors support multiple types of workloads, including complex AI workloads, and improve AI computation performance with the use of Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost (Intel&reg; DL Boost). Intel Deep Learning Boost includes Intel&reg; AVX-512 VNNI (Vector Neural Network Instructions) which is an extension to the Intel&reg; AVX-512 instruction set. It can combine three instructions into one for execution, which further unleashes the computing potential of next-generation Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable Processors and increases the inference performance of the INT8 model. Both 2nd-Generation and 3rd-Generation Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable Processors support VNNI.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="DL VNNI" height="176" src="/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/dl-vnni.jpg" width="855"/></p>

<p>Platforms not using VNNI require the&nbsp;<strong>vpmaddubsw, vpmaddwd&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;vpaddd</strong>&nbsp;instructions to complete the multiply-accumulate operations in INT8 convolution operation:</p>

|Processor configuration: Hyper-Threading|Enable|
|SNC (Sub NUMA)|Disable|
|Boot performance mode|Max Performance|
|Turbo Mode|Enable|
|Power and Performanace: Hardware P-States|Native Mode|

### Memory

Use all available memory channels

### CPU

FMA, the Intel AVX-512 acceleration module, is an important component for unleashing computational performance.  In order to achieve better computing performance, use the Intel Xeon&reg; Scalable Processors Gold 6 series (or above) which have two Intel AVX512 computational modules per core.

Note:  To confirm that AVX-512 is supported by the CPU, enter the following command and look for avx512 in the "flags" section.

```
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo
```

### Network

If cross-node training clusters are required, choose high-speed networks, such as 25G/100G, for better scalability.

### Hard drive

For high I/O efficiency, use SSDs and drives with higher read and write speeds.

## Linux Operating System Optimization

To speed up processing tune the Linux operating system for parallel programming.

### OpenMP Parameter Settings

The [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) is a specification for parallel programming.  Set these environment variables as follows:

- OMP_NUM_THREADS = &ldquo;number of cpu cores in container&rdquo;
- KMP_BLOCKTIME = 1 or 0 (set according to actual type of model)
- KMP_AFFINITY=granularity=fine, verbose, compact,1,0

### Number of CPU cores

Consider the impact on inference performance based on the number of CPU cores being used, as follows:

&bull; When batchsize is small (in online services for instance) the increase in inference throughput gradually weakens as the number of CPU cores increases.  In practice, 8-16 CPU cores is recommended for service deployment depending on the model used.

&bull; When batchsize is large (in offline services for instance) the inference throughput can increase linearly as the number of CPU cores increases.  In practice, more than 20 CPU cores is recommended for service deployment.

``` # taskset -C xxx-xxx –p pid (limits the number of CPU cores used in service) ```

### NUMA Configuration

For NUMA-based servers, there is usually a 5-10% increase in performance when configuring NUMA on the same node compared to using it on different nodes.

``` #numactl -N NUMA_NODE -l command args ... (controls NUMA nodes running in service) ```

### Configuration of Linux Performance Governor

Efficiency is the key consideration.  Set the CPU frequency to its peak for the best performance.

``` # cpupower frequency-set -g performance ```

### CPU C-States Settings

There are several power modes available for each CPU which are collectively referred to as C-states or C-modes.  To reduce power consumption when the CPU is idle, the CPU can be placed in the low-power mode.  Disabling C-States can increase performance.

``` #cpupower idle-set -d 2,3 ```

## Intel&reg; Optimization for TensorFlow* Deep Learning Framework

TensorFlow* is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks used in large-scale machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) applications. Since 2016, Intel and Google* engineers have been working together to use Intel&reg; oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (Intel&reg; oneDNN) to optimize TensorFlow* performance and accelerate its training and inference performance on the Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable Processor platform.

### Deploying Intel&reg; Optimization for TensorFlow* Deep Learning Framework

Reference: [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/guide/optimization-for-tensorflow-installation-guide.html](/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/guide/optimization-for-tensorflow-installation-guide.html)

Step 1: Install a Python3.x environment. Here is an example to illustrate how to build Python* 3.6 with Anaconda*

Reference: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

Download and install the latest version of Anaconda


``` 
# wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh

# sh Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh

# source /root/.bashrc

# conda install python=3.6 (create a Python3.6 environment)

#(base) [root@xx]# python -V

Python 3.6.10 
```

Step 2: Install the Intel optimation for TensorFlow*: intel-tensorflow.

Install the latest version (2.x)

``` 
# pip install intel-tensorflow 
```

If you need to install tensorflow1.x, we recommend installing the following version to take advantage of the performance acceleration on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Gen Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable Processor platform:

``` 
# pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/intel-optimized-tensorflow/intel_tensorflow-1.15.0up2-cp36-cp36m-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl 
```

Step 3: Set run-time optimization parameters.

Reference:

[https://github.com/IntelAI/models/blob/master/docs/general/tensorflow/GeneralBestPractices.md](https://github.com/IntelAI/models/blob/master/docs/general/tensorflow/GeneralBestPractices.md)

Usually, the following two methods are used for inference, which use different optimization settings

 Batch inference: Batch Size &gt;1, measures the number of input tensors that can be processed per second. Usually, all the physical cores in the same CPU socket can be used for batch inference to achieve the best performance.

 On-line inference (also known as real-time inference):  Batch Size=1, a measure of time needed to process one input tensor (when the batch size is 1). In real-time inference, multiple instances are run concurrently to achieve the optimal throughput.

1: Obtaining the number of physical cores in the system:

To confirm the current number of physical cores, we recommend using the following command:

``` 
# lscpu | grep "Core(s) per socket" | cut -d':' -f2 | xargs 
```

You may also use this command to list all physical cores for all sockets:

```
$ lscpu -b -p=Core,Socket | grep -v '^#' | sort -u | wc -l
```

In this example, we assume 8 physical cores.

2: Setting optimization parameters:

Optimization parameters are configured using the two following methods. Please choose the configuration method according to your needs.

Method 1: Configure environment parameters directly:

``` 
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=physical cores

export KMP_AFFINITY="granularity=fine,verbose,compact,1,0"

export KMP_BLOCKTIME=1

export KMP_SETTINGS=1 
```

Method 2: Add environment variables in the Python code that is running:


``` 
import os

os.environ["KMP_BLOCKTIME"] = "1"

os.environ["KMP_SETTINGS"] = "1"

os.environ["KMP_AFFINITY"]= "granularity=fine,verbose,compact,1,0"

if FLAGS.num_intra_threads &gt; 0:

os.environ["OMP_NUM_THREADS"]= # &lt;physical cores&gt;

config = tf.ConfigProto()

config.intra_op_parallelism_threads = # &lt;physical cores&gt;

config.inter_op_parallelism_threads = 1

tf.Session(config=config) 
```

### Applications &ndash; Inferencing and Training Using Intel Optimized TensorFlow Wide &amp; Deep Model

Among the many operations in the data center, it is a typical application to use recommendation systems to match users with content they are interested in. Recommendation system is a type of information filtering system that learns about users&#39; interests according to their profiles and past behavior records and predict their ratings or preferences for a given item. It changes the way a business communicates with users and enhances the interaction between the business and its users.

When using deep learning, we find, from a large amount of complex raw data, the deep interactions between features that are difficult to be expressed with traditional machines using artificial feature engineering. Related study outcomes include Wide &amp; Deep, DeepFM, FNN, DCN, and other models.

Using the Wide &amp; Deep model as an example, the core idea is to take advantage of both the memorization capability of a linear model and the generalization capability of the DNN model and optimize the parameters in these models at the same time during training. This will result in better overall model prediction capabilities. Its structure is shown in the figure below:

![Deep learning structure](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/dl-structure.jpg)

 Wide

&quot;Wide&quot; is a generalized linear model, and its inputs mainly include original and interactive features. We can use cross-product transformation to build the interactive features of K-group:

![wide linear model](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/dl-wide.jpg)

 Deep

&ldquo;Deep&rdquo; is a DNN model, and the calculation for each layer is as follows:

![Deep DNN model](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/dl-deep.jpg)

 Co-training

The Wide &amp; Deep model uses co-training instead of integration. The difference is that co-training shares a loss function, then updates the parameters in either part of the model at the same time, while integration trains N models independently and fuses them together afterwards. Therefore, the output of the model is:

![Deep learning co-training](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/dl-cotrain.jpg)

The above is the background information on the Wide &amp; Deep model. Next, we will describe how to run inference benchmarking for the Wide &amp; Deep model.

### Intel&reg; Math Kernel Library (MKL) Threadpool-Based TensorFlow (Optional)

Starting with TensorFlow 2.3.0, a new feature has been added. You can choose Eigen Threadpool for TensorFlow multi-threading support instead of OpenMP, by using the compiling option --config=mkl_threadpool instead of --config=mkl, when compiling the Tensorflow source code.

If the user wants to try this feature with TensorFlow 1.15, they need to download the source code that has been ported and optimized by Intel and compile it (it should be particularly pointed out that  Bazel* 0.24.1 needs to be installed for the purpose):


``` 
# git clone https://github.com/Intel-tensorflow/tensorflow.git

# git checkout -b tf-1.15-maint remotes/origin/tf-1.15-maint

# bazel --output_user_root=$BUILD_DIR build --config=mkl_threadpool -c opt --copt=-O3 //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package $BUILD_DIR 
```

After successfully completing the steps above, the TensorFlow  <em>wheel</em> file can be found under the  <em>$BUILD_DIR</em> path. For example:  <em>tensorflow-1.15.0up2-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl</em>. The installation steps are as follows:


``` 
# pip uninstall tensorflow

# pip install $BUILD_DIR/&lt;filename&gt;.whl --user 
```

## Using PyTorch*, a Deep Learning Framework

### Deploying PyTorch

Reference: [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/guide/getting-started-with-intel-optimization-of-pytorch.html](/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/guide/getting-started-with-intel-optimization-of-pytorch.html)

Environment: Python3.6 or above

Step 1: Visit the official PyTorch website: [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/)

Step 2: Select CPU

Currently, Intel oneDNN is integrated into the official version of PyTorch, so there is no need for additional installation to have accelerated performance on the Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable Processor platform. Select &ldquo;None&rdquo; for CUDA. See the figure below for details.

![oneDNN](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/dl-onednn.jpg)

Step 3: Installation


``` 
pip install torch==1.7.1+cpu torchvision==0.8.2+cpu torchaudio==0.7.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html 
```


### Optimization Recommendations for Training and Inferencing PyTorch-based Deep Learning Models

You may refer to the following website to learn more about optimization parameter settings for PyTorch* on the Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable Processor platform.

### Introducing and Using Intel&reg; Extension for PyTorch

Intel&reg; Extension for PyTorch is a Python extension of PyTorch that aims to improve the computational performance of PyTorch on Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Processors. Not only does this extension includes additional functions, but it also provides performance optimizations for new Intel hardware.

The Github links to the Intel Extension for PyTorch are:

[https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch)

[https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/AI-and-Analytics/Features-and-Functionality/IntelPyTorch_Extensions_AutoMixedPrecision](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/AI-and-Analytics/Features-and-Functionality/IntelPyTorch_Extensions_AutoMixedPrecision)

## Accelerating Vector Recall in the Recommendation System with Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost VNNI

A problem that needs to be resolved in the recommendation system is how to generate a recommendation list with the length of K for a given user that matches their interests and needs as much as possible (high accuracy) and as fast as possible (low latency)? Conventional recommendation systems include two components: vector recall and ranking. &ldquo;Vector recall&rdquo; roughly filters out hundreds or thousands of items from a huge recommendation pool that will most likely interest the user, passes the results on to the ranking module for further sorting before the final recommendation results are obtained.

![Deep learning vector recall](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/dl-vector-recall.jpg)

Vector recall can be converted into a high-dimensional vector similarity search problem.

The Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm is a type of Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) vector similarity search algorithm based on graph structures. It is also one of the fastest and most precise algorithms.

![ANN](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/dl-ann.jpg)

Usually, the data type of the raw vector data is FP32. For many applications (such as image search), vector data can be expressed in INT8/INT6 and the impact of quantization error on the final search result is limited. The &ldquo;VNNI intrinsic&rdquo; instruction can be used for inner product calculations for INT8/INT6 vectors. Many experiments have shown that QPS Performance has greatly improved, and that recall rate remains virtually unchanged. The reason for the improvement in QPS performance is that the memory&ndash;bandwidth ratio for INT8/INT16 is smaller than for FP32, and VNNI instructions accelerate the distance calculations in addition.

Currently, optimized source code is implemented based on the HNSWLib[10] open source project. We have already ported it to the Faiss[1] framework, which is widely used in the industry.

To achieve the optimal performance, the following deployment steps are recommended:

- Bind NUMA
- Each physical CPU core executes a single query process

Reference command (using 1 socket and 24 cores as an example):

``` 
# numactl -C 0-23 <test_program> 
```

When the dataset is large (in the range of 100 million to billions for example), the traditional approach is to slice the dataset into several smaller datasets to get the  topK for each dataset separately before merging them back together at the end. Since the amount of communication between multiple machines has increased, latency also increases while the QPS performance decreases. Our experience with HNSW on large datasets show that it is better not to slice datasets if possible, but rather establish indices and execute searches on complete datasets to get the best performance. When a dataset is too large and there is not enough DDR space (e.g. local memory space), you can consider using PMem (Intel&reg; Optane&trade; persistent memory)

By saving the  HNSW layer0 data on PMEM, the size of the dataset that can be supported has greatly increased (a single socket can support an INT8 database with up to 4 billion records @  d=100). The persistence feature allows you to skip the loading process for a large amount of data, which greatly reduces the time it takes to initialize.

## AI Neural Network Model Quantization

### AI neural network quantization process

Computations in neural networks are mainly concentrated in the convolutional layer and the fully connected layer. The computations on these two layers can be expressed as:  Y = X * Weights + Bias. Therefore, it is natural to focus on matrix multiplication to optimize performance. The way to begin neural network model quantization is by trading-off precision (limited) for performance improvement. By replacing 32-bit floating-point numbers with low-precision integers for matrix operations, it not only speeds up calculations, but also compresses the model, thus saving memory bandwidth.

There are three approaches to the quantization of neural network models:

- Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), which is supported by most AI frameworks.
- Quantization-Aware-Training (QAT), which inserts the  FakeQuantization node into the FP32 model when the training converges. It increases the quantization-induced noise. During the backpropagation stage of the training, the model weights fall into a finite interval which results in better quantization precision.
- Dynamic Quantization (DQ) is very similar to PTQ. They are both quantization methods used on post-trained models. The difference lies in that the quantization factor in the activation layer is dynamically decided by the data range used when the neural network model is run, while for PTQ samples from a small-scale pre-processed dataset are used to obtain data distribution and range information in the activation layer, then records it permanently in the newly generated quantization model. Of the Intel&reg; Intel&reg; Neural Compressor which we will talk about later on,  onnxruntime supports this method at the backend only.

The basic procedure for the post-training quantization of neural networks is as follows:

1. Fuse FP32 OP to INT8 OP. For example, <em>MatMul</em>, <em>BiasAdd</em> and <em>ReLU</em> can be fused into a single quantized OP at the fully connected layer,  <em>QuantizedMatMulWithBiasAndRelu</em>. Different neural network frameworks support different fuse-able OPs. For Intel&reg; Intel&reg; Neural Compressor, which will be discussed later on, below we can see a list of fuse-able OPs supported by TensorFlow: [https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/neural_compressor/adaptor/tensorflow.yaml#L110](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/neural_compressor/adaptor/tensorflow.yaml#L110).

For fuse-able OPs supported by pyTorch, please see : [https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/neural_compressor/adaptor/pytorch_cpu.yaml#L251](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/neural_compressor/adaptor/pytorch_cpu.yaml#L251)

2. Quantize weights and save them in the quantized model.

3. Quantize the input/activation layer by sampling the calibration dataset to acquire the distribution and range information of the data in the activation layer, which is then recorded in the newly generated quantized model.

4. The Requantize operation is fused into its corresponding INT8 OP to generate the final quantized model.

Using a simple model which includes two layers of  MatMul as an example, we can observe the quantization process as follows:

![MatMul](/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/images/dl-matmul.jpg)

### Intel&reg; Neural Compressor

[Intel® Neural Compressor](https://intel.github.io/neural-compressor) is one of the key AI software components in the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit.  It is an open-source Python library that runs on Intel CPUs and GPUs.  This toolkit delivers unified interfaces across multiple deep learning frameworks for popular network compression technologies, such as quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. It supports automatic, accuracy-driven, tuning strategies to quickly find the best model.  It also implements different weight pruning algorithms to generate a pruned model with a pre-defined sparsity goal and it supports knowledge distillation from a teacher model to a student model.
